# About Me

I got my start in programming and software development in my pre-teens developing scripts and modifications for video games in my spare time. I've honed these skills over the past nearly two decades, becoming a full-stack developer with expertise in a wide array of languages and frameworks.

## Skills

I actively work with languages and frameworks including `JavaScript`, `C#`, `Python`, `NextJS`, `DotNET Core` using `Visual Studio Code` as my primary IDE. I take great pleasure in crafting applications with excellent user experience, maintainability and efficiency.

## Projects

I contribute heavily to [AGiXT]([https://github.com/Josh-XT/Agent-LLM](https://github.com/Josh-XT/AGiXT)), a versatile Python application utilizing AI language models for task management and problem-solving. It supports various AI providers including OpenAI GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Oobabooga Text Generation Web UI, llama.cpp, and more, with the list continually expanding. 

I previously developed a very well recieved modification for the video game Fallout 4, adding several textures and quality of life features to one of the game mechanics. 

Additionally I am involved in several private projects.
